Prject posidon leverage the data science and machine learning techiques to develop a novel solution for water crisis problem by predicting the status of water infastructure of different communities accross Tanzania. The developed model is deployed on a django based webapp to increase it's global outreach.
The project support's following [UN sustainable development goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals)
* Goal 6 - Clean water and sanitation 
* Goal 3 – Good Health and Well-Being  
* Goal 17 – Partnerships for Goals
* Goal 11 – Sustainable Cities and communities

We welcome contributions in this project by forking this repository.
